## Welcome<a name="about"></a>
The **Winter School 2024 on Data Systems**, organized by the Data Systems Group of the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/) at IIT Delhi, will be held from **December 2nd to December 6th, 2024**. Supported by the Mohit Aron Endowment, this winter school provides an exceptional opportunity for final-year undergraduate students, master’s and PhD students, and industry professionals to deepen their knowledge in **scalable systems for Big Data, Data Science and AI**. 

Participants will engage in lectures and hands-on lab sessions on a range of data systems topics, led by [Prof. Kaustubh Beedkar](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~kbeedkar) and [Prof. Abhilash Jindal](https://abhilash-jindal.com/). 

## List of Topics <a name="topics"></a>
The Winter School will cover the following topics:
- **MapReduce (Hadoop)**: Introduction to distributed data processing with Hadoop and the MapReduce model.
- **Iterative Functional Programming Models**: Modern data processing engines like Apache Spark, Flink, and Popper, including in-memory processing, scalability, and fault tolerance.
- **Vertex-centric and Bulk Synchronous Parallel Models**: Graph processing with vertex-centric approaches like Pregel/GraphLab and scalable graph computations using Graph-X.
- **Stream Data Processing**: Real-time data pipelines with Spark Streaming and Apache Flink, covering concepts like windowing and event-time processing.
- **Cross-platform Data Processing**: Introduction to Wayang, a platform for cross-framework data processing, allowing optimizations across Spark, Flink, and Relational Databases.
